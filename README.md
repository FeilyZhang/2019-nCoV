# 2019-nCoV
2019-nCoV data platform command line client.

## Getting

If you want source code, you can

```
git clone https://github.com/FeilyZhang/2019-nCoV.git
```

If you just want to use it simply, you can download the compressed package [here](https://github.com/FeilyZhang/2019-nCoV/releases/tag/v0.01).

## How to use

You need to install JDK1.8 or jre1.8 (if you just want to run it), configure your environment variables (there are many tutorials on the Internet), and then double-click the bat file to run it.

Of course, you can also add the bat file to the path variable under your environment variable, so that you can run it from the command prompt under CMD, with the command of `2019ncov`.
